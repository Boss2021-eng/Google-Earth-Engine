# **Google Earth Engine Workshop**

This workshop explored geospatial analysis using Google Earth Engine. Exercises included Digital Elevation Model (DEM) analysis, monitoring tree loss and gain, natural land cover mapping, and temperature monitoring. Participants learned to process large datasets, visualize changes, and apply environmental monitoring techniques using the GEE platform and JEarth Engine API.
